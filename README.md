## 📖 About The Project

**Do It For The XP** is a gamified task management application that transforms everyday responsibilities into an exciting Role-Playing Game (RPG). Built with **Vue 3, Ionic, and Capacitor**, it brings the fantasy world into your daily routine, whether you're on the web, Android, or iOS.

In this world, **Parents represent the Game Masters (GM)**, guiding the adventure, while children (and the young at heart) become **Bounty Hunters**, completing tasks to earn rewards, level up, and unlock new abilities.

### 🌟 The "Lore" & Features

*   **Quest System**: Chores aren't just work; they are Quests! Complete them to earn **XP** (Experience Points) and **AP** (Ability Points).
*   **Class System**: Choose your Job Class! As you gain levels, you unlock specific **Abilities**, **Spells**, and **Badges**.
*   **Hometown Hub**: Visit your personal hometown to manage your resources:
    *   🏪 **Store**: Spend your hard-earned **GP** (Gold Points) on items and accessories.
    *   🏥 **Hospital**: Restore **HP** (Health Points) and manage your wellness.
    *   🏦 **Bank**: Save and invest your GP.
    *   🏛️ **Temple**: Train your mind and abilities.
*   **Battle System**: Engage in battles representing tasks and achievements within the **Battleground**.
*   **Cross-Platform**: Play on your phone, tablet, or desktop.
